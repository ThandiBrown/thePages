Category of Competition: Best UX

Hi! Our project is about making a wesbite for people who love dark TV shows - specifies that of Black Mirrror,
Mr. Robot and Bojack Horseman. 

The experience starts on a place called "The Happy Pages" that shows a deceivingly positive take on all the shows.
What the user finds out as they look beneath the surface is that there are ridden figures and that furthermore The
Happy Pages is actually a false website!

Things to Catch:
1. The Sponsored Link by E-Corp at the top of the Robot page that poses E-Corp as this family friend, safe company 
that may even have your family's back more that it's own
2. The Happy Articles Title that serves as a warning and adds more mystery
3. Then the finale: Click on the smiley face to enter The Dark Pages
** Have the volume up

Once on the Dark Pages, click the titles to return to the previous pages or uncover videos
On the blogs, click "E Corp" at the very bottom in read to uncover their secret
& In the Black Mirror Analysis part, click on the imagines, then click again on the new site to look that review sections.
